					<li><strong>Paramedic</strong><br>
						I've been a paramedic since 2009.  I love working on the ambulance and responding to 911 calls.  It's a great feeling to be able to say that I played a role in saving someobody's life.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Nurse</strong><br>
						I recently graduated from nursing school as a Registered Nurse.  Instead of getting a job as a nurse, I decided to come here and play with computers.</li><br>
					<li><strong>CPR Instructor</strong><br>
						I have been teaching medical courses for a long time, beginning with Lifeguarding.  I own and operate a CPR training center in San Antonio.  I have two other instructors.  Hopefully they're actually working while I'm here for 10 weeks......</li>

					<li><strong>Swimming</strong><br>
						I think I'm half fish because I absoultely love swimming.  My summers are pretty much spent at the river or at a pool.  I've been a lifeguard, taught swim lessons, and won a gold medal in the olympics.  Just kidding--you probably didn't read this far, anyway.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Photography</strong><br>
						I have a pretty good camera which takes high-quality photos.  I like to say that I'm an amerature photographer, but it's probably just because of the good camera.  Skills aside, I've taken some cool photos!</li><br>
